# Predicting Mobile App Churn Using Feature Importance and User Segmentation

## Overview

This project analyzes user engagement data to predict mobile app churn and identify key behavioral patterns associated with churn.  The analysis utilizes feature importance techniques to pinpoint the most influential factors contributing to churn and employs user segmentation to create targeted retention strategies.  The project generates insights into user behavior and provides a foundation for developing effective interventions to improve user retention.

## Technologies Used

* Python 3
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Scikit-learn
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn

## How to Run

1. **Install Dependencies:**  Ensure you have Python 3 installed.  Then, navigate to the project directory in your terminal and install the required Python libraries using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the Analysis:** Execute the main script using:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Example Output

The script will print key findings from the analysis to the console, including:

* Summary statistics of the dataset.
* Feature importance scores indicating the most influential factors in predicting churn.
* Results of user segmentation and characteristics of each segment.

Additionally, the project generates several visualization files (e.g., plots showing churn rate over time, feature importance rankings, and segment characteristics) in the `output` directory.  These visualizations provide a visual representation of the key insights.  The exact file names may vary.
